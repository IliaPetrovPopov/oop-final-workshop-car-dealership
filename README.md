## OOP Workshop - Car Dealership

There are three types of vehicles in the Car Dealership for now, **Car**, **Motorcycle** and **Truck**. Your task is to implement them and the rest of the classes in the project. The project is already structured and you should not change the structure. You should only implement the empty classes and interfaces. You can add new classes where needed and modify any of the existing code under the **models** package if necessary.

Each of the vehicles has **make**, **model**, **price**,  **wheels**, **type** and an array of **comments**.

Specific for each type of vehicle are the following:
- The **Car** type has **seats**
- The **Motorcycle** type has a **category**
- The **Truck** type has a **weight capacity**

There are users in the Car Dealership as well.
Each **User** has **username**, **first name**, **last name**, **password** and **role** and can do the following actions:
- **AddVehicle**, **RemoveVehicle**, **AddComment** and **RemoveComment**
- Every user has collection of **Vehicles** and every **Vehicle** in this collection has collection of **Comments**.
- Users should **register** and **login** before doing anything in the Car Dealership. If a user is not logged or there is another user logged in he cannot do anything. This is already implemented and you are not expected to do anything here (but you can still figure out how it works :) ).

### Validation

**The error messages and all the constraints for each field that must be validated can be *found in the example output*. If you are unsure about some constraints, run the tests. You already have the error messages in the proper classes.**

- Vehicle validation
  - Make length should be between 2 and 15 symbols
  - Model length should be between 1 and 15 symbols
  - Price range should be between 0.0 and 1000000.0
  - Wheels count should be appropriate for the vehicle type
  - Seats count should as defined in the respective class
  - Category length should as defined in the respective class
  - Weight capacity should as defined in the respective class

- Comment validation
  - The content of the comment should not be less than 3 or more than 200 characters long.

- User validation
  - username should not be between 3 and 20 characters long
  - password should not be between 5 and 30 characters long
  - first and last name should not be between 3 and 20 characters long

**All properties cannot be null, negative, empty or undefined**

### User actions

- Adding a vehicle
  - If the user is admin he cannot add a vehicle
  - If the user is not VIP he cannot add more than 5 vehicles

- Adding a comment
  - Just add the comment to the list

- Remove a vehicle
  - Just remove the vehicle from the list

- Remove a comment
  - If the author of the comment is not the current user he cannot remove it

### Printing

- For the User class

`Username: {Username}, FullName: {FirstName} {LastName}, Role: {Role}`

- For all vehicles of the user

```none
--USER {Username}--
1. {Vehicle type}:
Make: {Make}
Model: {Model}
Wheels: {Wheels}
Price: ${Price}
Category/Weight capacity/Seats: {Category/Weight capacity/Seats}
--COMMENTS--
----------
{Content}
User: {Comment Username}
----------
----------
{Content}
User: {Comment username}
----------
--COMMENTS--
2. {Vehicle type}:
Make: {Make}
Model: {Model}
Wheels: {Wheels}
Price: ${Price}
Category/Weight capacity/Seats: {Category/Weight capacity/Seats}
--NO COMMENTS--
```

- **The dashes separating the comments are exactly 10.**
- **Price has `$` in front of the value and has no trailing zeros** *(e.g. `Price: $10000`)*

- **The weight capacity has `t` after the value** *(e.g. `Weight capacity: 40t`)*
- **Look into the example below to get better understanding of the printing format.**

#### Additional Notes

To simplify your work you are given an already built execution engine that executes a sequence of commands read from the console using the classes and interfaces in your project.

You should implement the empty classes. You can add new classes where needed and modify any of the existing code under the **models** package if necessary.

Currently, the engine supports the following commands:

- **RegisterUser** **(username, firstName, lastName, password, role)** - registers user, if there is no such user already
- **Login** **(username, password)** - logs in user if there is no already logged in and there is such registered user
- **Logout** - logs out the current logged in user
- **AddVehicle** **(type, make, model, price, [category/seats/weightCapacity])** - adds a vehicle to the current user. The fourth parameter depends on the type of the vehicle
- **RemoveVehicle** **(vehicleIndex)** - remove the vehicle on that index if there is such
- **AddComment** **(content, author, vehicleIndex)** - add a comment with the content provided to the vehicle with that index and sets the author
- **RemoveComment** **(vehicleIndex, commentIndex, username)** - removes the comment from the vehicle
- **ShowVehicles** **(username)** - shows all the vehicles of the user

Commands that you should implement yourself:
- **ShowUsers** - shows all the users registered.

**All commands return appropriate success messages. In case of invalid operation or error, the engine returns appropriate error messages.**

### Step by step guide


**1.** Implement the classes in which there is a TODO.
**Hint:** Implement Vehicles classes first, then print methods and finally ShowUsersCommand.
**Hint:** You can check all TODOs in a project by pressing CTRL+SHIFT+F then searching for TODO.

**2.** Validate all properties according to the guidelines set above.

**3.** Try running the tests. You can run them by class in order to orient yourself more easily.

**4.** Implement printing.

- Implement the print() method. Is there a way to implement base print() method in Vehicle class and only add specialized information in the sub-classes?

**5.** Uncomment the methods inside the User class

NOTE: Even if output is not exactly the same, but similiar enough that is ok!
